        <div class="subheading mb-5">Theater, Film and Digital Production</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Yasmine Mussa Khiar, also known as the “Jazz,” is a studious student on the campus of the University of California - Riverside and a filmer for African Student Programs located in Costo Hall as well as the Student Recreation Center located on Aberdeen and Inverness Drive. She is a first year who has created a creative organization and is one of the presidents of it. After graduating from strict highschool from the Middle East specifically Riyadh in Saudi Arabia, I enrolled in film and theater classes to pursue my joy of filming and editing as well as post and pre production. Being in Saudi Arabia, she was exposed to the tech part of the modern Arab world with Excel, Word, Powerpoint and Access as normal class requirements. Whenever she got discouraged in her hard studies and started to heavily procrastinate, the words of her favorite art teacher back home kept her grounded and well aware, which is how she made it through the stressful times and difficult situations till this day. She would also remember the long deep and emotional conversations she had with her father who was an Information Technology Manager of a big bank back in Saudi Arabia when she was younger.<br><br>

        She applied to a PATH scholarship for the Winter 2020 quarter here on the campus of the University of California - Riverside and had received it effortlessly. She also applied for private loans outside of the University of California - Riverside system in order to pursue further education which she had no issues receiving as well . In addition to further education, she enjoys taking photographs of people and nature as well as animals. She also enjoys painting and drawing as well as editing and filming with her Canon Rebel T5i and Adobe Premiere Pro CC. She has also volunteered for her Women in Music class where a conference was held and indeginious mariachi band had came to perform on the campus of University of California - Riverside for a few hours straight. I have also helped volunteer at her family reunion gatherings in different states along with her friends and direct and indirect family helping set up and clean up as well as direct family the right way. She has also helped clean cars when younger for family members and had volunteered to hold a food drive for the homeless around her neighborhood.<br><br>

        Yasmine Mussa Khiar resides in Riverside with her three friendly roommates, where they are devoted students with a lot of school work to complete to keep up with the University of California quarter system, along with eight more hall mates as they live in PATH or the Pan African Themed Hall. She has successfully completed taking thirty one units in total starting from Fall 2019 to Winter 2020 here on the campus of the University of California - Riverside. To sum up, she is an experienced individual with different exposure to multiple cultures. She is ambitious and aims to do better in the future and for the future.
